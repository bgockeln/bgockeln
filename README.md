Learning my way through Linux, IT security, and digital forensics — and thinking a lot about the impact of AI on society.


### Linux

Over the past 10 years, I've used Linux on and off — mostly through VirtualBox, sometimes as my main OS. I’ve installed Arch Linux from scratch, got tiling window managers like Qtile and Awesome running, configured a GUI-less mp3 setup with `moc`, and fixed real issues like broken sound or printer configs.

I’m no sysadmin, but I can find my way around. If I don’t know something, I’ll check the man pages or look it up. These days, I work with Linux mainly through WSL and VirtualBox on Windows.


### IT Security

I’ve explored basic CTFs in the past (HackTheBox-style challenges), mostly around SSH, FTP, and SQL exploitation. That was a couple of years ago, and while I don’t remember everything, the exposure helped shape my interest.


### Digital Forensics

A new interest, but a serious one. I’m starting my first small project analyzing browser artifacts — just to learn how traces are left and what can be recovered. If it clicks, this could turn into a long-term focus or even a career path.


### AI Ethics

Probably the topic I think about the most lately.

- Will AI mostly be used to cut costs and replace jobs?
- Will it create a new market for emotional dependency — like paywalled AI companions?
- Could it be meaningful in therapeutic settings?
  
I think we'll be impacted by this on a level we don’t fully understand yet. The only question is: for better or for worse?
